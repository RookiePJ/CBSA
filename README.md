CBSA Course
Blockchain is really about providing value to the enterprise. Architecting Enterprise Blockchain Solutions provides expert insight into enterprise blockchain understanding and direction for enterprise focused sales teams who are both technical and non-technical, systems engineers, application developers and IT executives.
The exam objectives are clearly listed on the Blockchain Training Alliance’s (BTA) website. BTA calls the exam objectives actually “skill sets” to be clear on their website.  
I have participated professionally in several areas of exam development and know more than a thing or two about test development stages. 
From an experience standpoint I was a prior CompTIA SME and Brocade SME who has participated in the development of 8 exams at various levels such as Item Development, Job Task Analysis and Cut Score exercises. 
I can state that I believe overall the exam objectives are fairly clear at a macro level and give potential test candidates a high level of what to expect.  
However, I do not believe the exam objectives are at a micro level detailed enough for certification candidates and therefore I have found this can cause students to get a bit overwhelmed.  Having vague objectives can be misleading and can cause exam candidates to be studying wrong subject areas.  For example, Ethereum and Hyperledger basics and use cases are tested on the exam but there is nothing in the exam stating these blockchains.  
 For examples, of well written exam objectives clearly defined in sections and in a logical order view any of CompTIA’s exam objectives for what I mean. 
The main value of this book I believe will be focused on exam candidates that did take an official vendor course which at the time of writing is 3 days. 
I will break down each of these tested objectives (skillsets) simply in a logical order and easy to digest format for an efficient test preparation process. 
The book will also provide significant detail from real working experience as part of the objective’s coverage.
My opinion of the Blockchain Training Alliance’s (BTA) objectives (skill sets) are that they are vague but with some minor efforts could be professionally specified without challenging the exam security and experience. This is their first take, so credit needs to be given especially with no real competition in the blockchain education market. 
Overall, I believe it’s a great exam and worth your effort.
